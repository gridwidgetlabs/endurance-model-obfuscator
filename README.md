# endurance-model-obfuscator
This is a library for removing CEII information from PSS/E network models so
that they can be distributed for reports, presentations, or for collaboration
with researchers. A mapping file is also generated so that CEII information
can be re-mapped to the shared model by the owner.

This library depends on the *Endurance SDK* (closed source) provided by
*Grid Widget Labs*
